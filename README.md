# Tower-of-Hanoi
> Welcome to my take on Tower of Hanoi. This mathematical game piqued my interest as a kid, and I am happy to share that I was able to recreate it as a front-end game. Enjoy!

## Rules of the Game
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game/puzzle that consists of 3 towers and disks of various diameters. The disks are stacked on top of each other, in descending order only. **Larger disks are not allowed to be placed on top of smaller ones.** The goal is to deconstruct the tower of disks from the left-most tower and reconstruct them on the right-most tower.

In order to do so, the player must move only the disk at the very top, one by one.

## How to Play
You must click the disk at the very top of the tower, and then click on the tower you wish to move it to. Remember, larger disks cannot be placed on top of smaller ones. If you attempt to do so, this will count as an error. Try to reconstruct the tower in the right-most box as fast and efficiently as possible. 

This game comes with a solve button. When clicked, this will solve the level for you (at any difficulty). This will show you what steps you need to take, and will even write them out for you! Of course, you should try to complete each level without this, but it never hurts to see the optimal solution!

To start, just follow the deployed link and get playing!
